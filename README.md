# The Kraken

It has been summoned...

The Kraken is Qudo's one-stop shop for feature selection, clustering, inference, and metric production
for Qudo's questionniare data. It relies heavily on Aphrodite to clean and pre-process the data. 

## Getting Started

### Installation 

The Kraken requires anaconda and R (at least 4.2). For local installations please use the 
`environment.yml` file, invoked by the following command:

```  conda env create -f environment.yml  ```

``` conda activate kraken ```

To install R, go to https://cloud.r-project.org/ and select the correct operating system. 

Once this is installed, run `R < requirements.R`

In production or the AWS environment, the `buildspec.yml` is run, which creates the correct environment.

To test the code locally, please navigate to `file_for_local_dev.py` and step through that code.

#### Installation via Windows

If you have a Windows machine and working via PyCharm. You may encounter issues with the package `rpy2`. 
When importing the package, if you encounter 'error 0x7e', you may need to implement the following:

1. In Windows: 'Edit the system environment variables' > 'Advanced' > 'Environment Variables' > 'Path' > 'Edit' > Add 'C:\Program Files\R\R-4.2.2\bin\x64' as a new line.
2. In PyCharm: 'Edit Configurations' > 'Environment Variables' > set the following:
   - R_HOME: C:\Program Files\R\R-4.2.2
   - R_LIB_USER: C:\Program Files\R\R-4.2.2\bin\x64
   - R_USER: C:\Users\{user}\anaconda3\envs\kraken_2\Lib\site-packages\rpy2
